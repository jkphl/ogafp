Open Global Address Formatting Project (OGAFP)
==============================================

This project deals with the formatting of postal addresses and aims to provide a comprehensive database with as many global address formats as I could get hold of. I spent a lot of time collecting and entering data back in 2012 and always wanted to publish the results. Unfortunately, I never made the final steps to layout a database that's usable for anyone but me. So ... please be aware that
  
* the resources found in this repo are nothing more than the latest state of the project (2012),
* which is basically my input interface for working on the formatting template data,
* is completely lacking documentation,
* that I had to skip some extended resources (due to copyright reasons)
* and that I have no idea if I will ever resume working on this.

If there's anything you want to tell me regarding the project, please simply get in touch. :)
